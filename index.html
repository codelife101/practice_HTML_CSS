		<p>Kevin Rockatansky had always loved grand Moscow with its roasted, racid rivers. It was a place where he felt relaxed.</p>

		<p>He was a sympathetic, articulate, tea drinker with feathery elbows and dirty elbows. His friends saw him as a hot, happy hero. Once, he had even brought an ordinary baby bird back from the brink of death. That's the sort of man he was.</p>

		<p>Kevin walked over to the window and reflected on his damp surroundings. The moon shone like bopping lizards.
		Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Alex Cockle. Alex was a charming juggler with pretty elbows and chubby elbows.</p>

		<p>Kevin gulped. He was not prepared for Alex.
		As Kevin stepped outside and Alex came closer, he could see the creepy glint in his eye.
		Alex gazed with the affection of 9761 thoughtful kindhearted kittens. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want affection."
		Kevin looked back, even more sneezy and still fingering the crumpled knife. "Alex, get out of my house," he replied.</p>

		<p>They looked at each other with calm feelings, like two big, bored bears walking at a very creepy birthday party, which had reggae music playing in the background and two proud uncles thinking to the beat.</p>

		<p>Kevin regarded Alex's pretty elbows and chubby elbows. "I feel the same way!" revealed Kevin with a delighted grin.
		Alex looked concerned, his emotions blushing like a snotacular, stormy sausage.
		Then Alex came inside for a nice cup of tea.
		THE END </p>
